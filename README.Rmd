# Multiserver

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of Multiserver is to simulate how customers will go through a first come, first serve queuing system as long as “fate” has already decided when each customer will arrive and their service times.

## Installation

You can install the development version of Multiserver from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Het12345678/Multiserver")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(Multiserver)
data(Bank)
with(bank, Multiserver(arrival_time, service_time, 4))
## basic example code
```
